💁🏻‍♀️ My personal gatherings app! This is where my friends and family can sign up or log in to learn about the gatherings I'm hosting.

This is a Next.js app that integrates with Strapi, a headless CMS, to author data and create their corresponding APIs. These APIs are accessible by each user via a Magic plugin, which performs a passwordless authentication when the user signs up or logs in.

Enjoy 🎉

## Getting Started

First, ```yarn install``` and then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
